Here is the correct order to run the many scripts to auomatize the process.
Linux folder are scripts for linux systems.
Windows folders has scripts for windows systems.

IMPORTANT: each file.py contains an object called "main_dir" which refers to the directory where all the files used are (where you are working essentially). 
It must be MANUALLY changed to your selected absolute path for each file.py using a text editor.

Also, the rest of the path used refers to the folder name generated in PART0.

NOTE: the predicted structure generated must maintain a specific naming convention:
id-name_chain_residue-position_mutated-aminoacid.pdb

so it comes out something like:
1a43_A_218S.pdb

for multiple mutations:
1a43_A_218S_219S_220Y.pdb

If there are any error, let me know.

GUIDE: follow the order

PART0.py = generates all the folder for the following steps. You can put it manually in the main_dir line or through the input line that comes out. Paste the absolute path

PART1.py = it makes a first generic evaluation of all the matrixes of aaindex using the wild-type pdb structure and biopython around_search_neighbors function.

(for dataset S2648)
PART2_MODELLER.py
PART2_ROSETTA.py = generate the mutated structures

PART2-prep = prepare files for the next steps (deletes hydrogens atom mainly)
